# SelectionGame

A simple selection game

The game is a puzzle played on a 5-by-5 grid with 25 square blocks labeled with pictures of different fruits and vegetables. The game indicates to the player a specific fruit/vegetable, and the playerâ€™s goal is to find all the blocks that display the indicated fruit/vegetable. As each correct fruit is selected, all remaining blocks shuffle.
